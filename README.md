## Installation

The vls gem is normally used as a stand-alone utility. However, its
functionality may be added to any Ruby application. To do so you can add this
line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vls'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vls

The vls gem itself is found at: ( https://rubygems.org/gems/vls )
